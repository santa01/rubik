Rubik's Cube game

Lates version of the game is available at:
https://github.com/santa01/rubik

Controls:
    <RMB> - rotate the cube;
    <LMB> - move section;
    <P> - pause game;
    <S> - shuffle cube;
    <ESQ> - quit game.

This application was never designed to be a ready for production software
but a training project. Game renderer uses OpenGL 3.3 (as defined in shaders),
game requires SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf and fontconfig libraries to be
installed. CMakeLists.txt is a complete kludge and should be rewritten with
proper SDL2 and fontconfig package search.
