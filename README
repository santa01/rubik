Rubik's Cube game

Latest version of the game is available at:
https://github.com/santa01/rubik

Controls:

    <P> - pause game;
    <S> - shuffle cube;
    <ESQ> - quit game.

This application was never designed to be a ready for production software
but a training project. Game renderer uses OpenGL 3.3 (as defined in shaders),
game requires SDL2, SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf libraries to be installed.

By default rubik will try to load resources from /usr/local/share/rubik.
You can override this path at configure time:

    cmake -DRUBIK_DATADIR="/path/to/data/dir" .

For development its essential to use the project root as data directory:

    cmake -DRUBIK_DATADIR="." .
