Game renderer uses OpenGL 3.3 (as defined in shaders), game requires SDL2,
SDL2_image, SDL2_ttf and GLEW libraries to be installed. Rubik also requires
external math library: https://github.com/santa01/math

By default rubik will try to load resources from /usr/local/share/rubik.
You can override this path at configure time:

    cmake -DRUBIK_DATADIR="/path/to/data/dir" .

For development its essential to use the project root as data directory:

    cmake -DRUBIK_DATADIR="." .
